Generating MacOS desktop wallpapers from Markdown with ruby


This is a **total** WIP right now, there are scaling issues with the markdown.

The idea is to be able to put whatever you want on the desktop:
- cheat sheets for programming languages
- reminders
- random pictures

## How to use:

1. clone the git repo
2. run `bundle install`
3. edit the `EDIT_ME.md` file to contain whatever you want
4. run `ruby ./set_background.rb`
5. you can add columns with the `>` character instead of blockquotes
